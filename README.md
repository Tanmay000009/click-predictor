## Importance of AD Click
A higher CTR represents more interest in that specific campaign, whereas a lower CTR can show that your ad may not be as relevant. High CTRs are important because they show that more people are clicking through to your website. Along with this high CTRs also help to get better ad position for less money on online platforms like Google, Bing etc.
